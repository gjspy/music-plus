playerBar -> musicApp
TAB IGNORING DOES NOT WORK :(

for songs with too many plays (we are never ever getting back together 1b tv), see video detail from playerResponse.
	- this returns viewCount for this instance, not including non-explicit/deluxe album/other alts of song. (for "we are never." the original is included in the sum with tv.)

on select lyric (css:select) in lyrics pane,, popup window like spotify thing that people always tweet

FIX PLAYER PAGE SIZING
UPGRADE QUALITY OF FULLSCREEN VIDEO?

ARTISTS:
	- custom discog order (or just in album metadata set exact date!!)
	- custom names (twenty one pilots)

RATINGS:
	- custom ratings (star count?)
	- tags to label songs with

SONGS:
	- add lyrics to private
	- edit lyrics

improve udigdict, predefine paths

ONLY EVER ONE PRIVATE COUNTERPART, AS IF ALBUM HAS SAME NAME THEN WOULD BE ADDED TO SAME ALBUM (PRIVATE)
hide master-buttons on player page!! (no, make it a thing - editing lyrics!!)


next, please do naming stuff to make ti consistent, artists and //albums.
does album editing work with two being queued?
shuffling with two?

LOAD MWUTILS AS A MODULESCRIPT IN MAIN WORLD, LIKE EDITMODE. DONT SEND OVER FUNC BY FUNC ANYMORE, NO NEED FOR EVAL. ? INJECT WITH contentScript
n3rds-inc.time

add album metadata, icon from google drive!!
onDeletePlaylist, still deleting the wrong one?
update eventdriven & playerPageFeatures.



CLEAR QUEUE BUTTON DOESNT CLEAR SERVER QUEUE.
CLICK IT, THEN ADD SOMETHING ELSE TO THE QUEUE, THEN SHUFFLE IT.
SERVER RETURNS QUEUE WHICH HAS STUFF FROM OLD QUEUE IN IT!!
can i edit the request before its sent? change videoId to videoIds and add all except the 1
(egiting QP backing playlist, see dissmiss queue endpoint, in buildQueuePanelRenderer stuff)

have feature to have player page popout, and "add to queue" adds to that. while popped out, disable play buttons on playlist pages etc? or, make it only play if current is paused.


MAKE MINI WINDOW FOR TABLET, YT MUSIC WIDGET, make it auto appear on login and fill screen, using firefox as desktop backgorund ish user showcase mode smth
COULD DEFINE OWN MUSIC VIDEOS, IN /NEXT API CALL, playlistPanelVideoWrapperRenderer.counterpart.counterpartRenderer + segmentMan


MAKE IT CHANGE BROWSER THEME: browser.theme.update(), TO IMAGE OF ALBUM PLAYING!!
ON PAGE CLOSE, RESET TO STORED VALUE OF browser.theme.getCurrent() BEFORE STARTING.
STORE THIS! CAN TEL IF ITS OURS OR NOT, BASED ON IF IMG URL IS YT OR NOT.
couldnt set image from external url, try base64? (str repr of img)

MAKE IT NOT EVEN CALL YT, AND RETURN THE RESPONSE IN newFetch, NOT ACCESSING originalFetch()!

now need to edit tworowitemrenderers with custom metadata.
