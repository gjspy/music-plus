playerBar -> musicApp
TAB IGNORING DOES NOT WORK :(

for songs with too many plays (we are never ever getting back together 1b tv), see video detail from playerResponse.
	- this returns viewCount for this instance, not including non-explicit/deluxe album/other alts of song. (for "we are never." the original is included in the sum with tv.)

on select lyric (css:select) in lyrics pane,, popup window like spotify thing that people always tweet

FIX PLAYER PAGE SIZING
UPGRADE QUALITY OF FULLSCREEN VIDEO?

ARTISTS:
	- custom discog order (or just in album metadata set exact date!!)
	- custom names (twenty one pilots)

RATINGS:
	- custom ratings (star count?)
//	- tags to label songs with

SONGS:
	- add lyrics to private
	- edit lyrics

improve udigdict, predefine paths

ONLY EVER ONE PRIVATE COUNTERPART, AS IF ALBUM HAS SAME NAME THEN WOULD BE ADDED TO SAME ALBUM (PRIVATE)
hide master-buttons on player page!! (no, make it a thing - editing lyrics!!)


next, please do naming stuff to make ti consistent, artists and //albums.
does album editing work with two being queued?
#shuffling with two?

LOAD MWUTILS AS A MODULESCRIPT IN MAIN WORLD, LIKE EDITMODE. DONT SEND OVER FUNC BY FUNC ANYMORE, NO NEED FOR EVAL. ? INJECT WITH contentScript
n3rds-inc.time

onDeletePlaylist, still deleting the wrong one?
update eventdriven & playerPageFeatures.

EDIT AND DELETE BUTTON OF FOLDERS DON'T WORK (SIDEBAR)
BUTTON TO UPDATE LIGHT COLOURS BASED ON PLAYING.
/Xneed some sort of write lock for storage? eg: making a change, some cache event happens, overwrites and hides change.
make CATEGORIES and RATINGS. RATINGS = 1-5 stars or smth, categories = too pop, nice pop, no texture, etc...
//gotta fix extraSongs, how does it cope with adding multiple  what happens to index :(

CLEAR QUEUE BUTTON DOESNT CLEAR SERVER QUEUE.
CLICK IT, THEN ADD SOMETHING ELSE TO THE QUEUE, THEN SHUFFLE IT.
SERVER RETURNS QUEUE WHICH HAS STUFF FROM OLD QUEUE IN IT!!
can i edit the request before its sent? change videoId to videoIds and add all except the 1
(egiting QP backing playlist, see dissmiss queue endpoint, in buildQueuePanelRenderer stuff)

have feature to have player page popout, and "add to queue" adds to that. while popped out, disable play buttons on playlist pages etc? or, make it only play if current is paused.


MAKE MINI WINDOW FOR TABLET, YT MUSIC WIDGET, make it auto appear on login and fill screen, using firefox as desktop backgorund ish user showcase mode smth
COULD DEFINE OWN MUSIC VIDEOS, IN /NEXT API CALL, playlistPanelVideoWrapperRenderer.counterpart.counterpartRenderer + segmentMan


MAKE IT CHANGE BROWSER THEME: browser.theme.update(), TO IMAGE OF ALBUM PLAYING!!
ON PAGE CLOSE, RESET TO STORED VALUE OF browser.theme.getCurrent() BEFORE STARTING.
STORE THIS! CAN TEL IF ITS OURS OR NOT, BASED ON IF IMG URL IS YT OR NOT.
couldnt set image from external url, try base64? (str repr of img)

MAKE IT NOT EVEN CALL YT, AND RETURN THE RESPONSE IN newFetch, NOT ACCESSING originalFetch()!

now need to edit tworowitemrenderers with custom metadata.

CUSTOM VIEW COUNTS PLEASE!!! QUICKLY!!
CAN GET FROM YT, WHEN queueImpress COMES THRU, MIGHT BE IN /next API REQUEST?


//MAKE ADDING EXTRA SONGS, JUST POPUP WITH videoId and index
	- "remove" page, do squre popups, with cached information if its available, otherwise just videoId, index and whatever. do rows instead of square?
give ability to hide releases: Dawn FM alternate worlds, let me delete the others

custom automix!! or custom radio, based on selected albums (exclude skips!!)

what is makeAUtomixInteractable in playerPgaeFeatures?

"export human data" = give json response of playlist info, what songs (including name, album and id, for manual reading)

DOING NOW:
extraSongs nearly work, need to go back to
//light control works okay, undimming is a bit slow
DOES NOT work with private albums, no auth to get img in bkg script
LIGHT ROTATING almost works, does 4 clicks then jumps one (cw), test acw

//extra songs working, but check playlistSetVideoIds please, is looking odd. click first item in album (this is how tomorrow moves) and it stays hovered without a play button icon?

//REMOVE "DELETE SONG" FROM PPR

CLEAN POPUP: HAVE DROPDOWN FOR "Queue", "Playlist", "Other": Report, Share, ..

WORKING:
//- won't delete "delete song" button
//- WORKS playing live from paris when on page
-// DOESNT WORK playing done beat saber from sidebar while live from paris open. - buildFrom issue
//(think its actually just cus we dont select a videoRenderer, RDAMPL errors.)
//- check upscaling thumbnails works (ONLY UPSCALE ICONS FOR NEWLY CREATED ELEMS.)

STAGE CACHE UPDATE, ONLY PUBLISH TO SERVER EVERY MINUTE
EG, ON UPDATE FOR WHATEVER, ADD TO QUEUE, TIMEOUT 60 SECONDS, GET MOST RECENT FROM LOCAL STORAGE AND GO?


WHEN DO LYRIC EDITING, STORE THEM AS TXT FILES, NOT IN JSON.
MOVE CACHE TO SEPARATE TXT FILE, SHOULD RLLY HAVE CACHE FOLDER WITH A FILE PER ID.
YES DO THIS SUPER GOOD. EXPORT BUTTON TO RECEIVE A ZIP OF THEM!


LYRIC EDTING! PRIVATE SONGS ALL HAVE A UNIQUE LYRIC ENDPOINT!!














SOUNDS LIKE LINKS!!
todo: on cache, if tag playlist, update tags.
tag playlist thumbnails!!
playlist thimbnails!!
#MAKE IT ADD TO PLAYLIST WHEN CHOOSING UR NEW tag
MAKE IT NOT ADD TAGS TWICE WHEN UPDATING
CHECK VOERFLOW ON POPUP
MAKE IT NOT DO QUOTES FOR TAGS, HOW CAN I MAKE TEXT FOR THAT BETTER?
RATINGS NEXT.
#make it let u remove tags from items

#CAN'T MAKE SKIPS / CUSTOMISATION ON PRIV ONLY ALBUMS
#subtitle runs for album show unskipped time
#edit album artist

want "recently most played" to give a queue full of ur top songs, nto a radio of that song
for when we track plays.

#tloas deluxe doesnt have playlistSetVideoIds? //NOT THIS, INDEX issue.
albumify playlist.
folder icons

WORKS! LOOK AT WHETHER YT STATS THINK I DONT LIKE THE SONG:

polymerController.playerUiService.playerApi.addEventListener("onVideoProgress", (e) => {
	if (e >=180 ) polymerController.playerApi.seekTo(201)
})
polymerController.store.getState().queue.responsiveSignals.videoInteraction

use deletePlaylistEndpoint (from dismiss queue, look at dropdown), to make a new clear queue. can we edit the queue playlist as given in this endpoint to remove removedVideoIds?

song metadata editing - name, explicit, LYRICS, PLAY SECTION! SEE ABOVE! DO NOW!


*** NEW BACKUPS SYSTEM: ***
make it so it saves not literally EVERY time, but one every hour for the past 24 hours, then 1 a day for the past week/month?

CAME FROM /next/ SMALL TASK:
/*DONT DELETE THIS. ONGOING STRUGGLE, KEEP THE CODE!  let headerButtons = UDigDict(response, [
