	FOR ARTIST "SONGS" LIST, AUTO SORT BY N OF PLAYS, HAVE CHIP RENDERER WITH CUSTOM CONTINUATION WHICH MIDDLEWARE CATCHES AND DOESNT CALL, USE THIS TO SORT BETWEEN ORIGINAL ORDER AND NOT


to cache:
	playlist/album page:
		playlist metadata
		songs: metadata, navEndpoint/playEndpoint
	artist:
		discography: albums, eps, and singles: metadata so can create own buttons
	


good bkg: https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gP-rqVOBO3v93xd1fMYuOHc1iTM28UvQijoh8jhT5OcqC0KfZSrEQ4CXJvMc8W-pkJLUSaPWlDpVr0w=w1500-h844-l90-rj

done:
	sidebar:
		custom paper elements showing images and more useful information
		reorganise it, moving playlists where you want them
		folders to contain playlists (or other folders!)
		extra playlists that youtube doesn't load in (>50) added.
		any albums saved to your library added.
		can have artists + play their radios
		hiding elements
		our paper items added/removed when you create/delete a playlist without a refresh.
		can open playlists in new tab with middle mouse!!
		separators with/without titles depending what you want.
		rearranging elements by moving them to a temporary overflow
		carousel elements to have icons only which are still interactable.
		separators are allowe din carousels for more styling options
		"add to queue" buttons, instead of just abruptly playing.
		on cache update, sidebar refreshes too.
		our sidebar refreshes when youtube refreshes theirs.
		can middle-click primary buttons - home, explore and library
		paper items have text runs, so can navigate to album artist from subtitle.
	
	search bar now a button, incorporated in sidebar.
	
	fixed background gradient on album pages.
	player-bar has nicer background.
	player-slider has nice background or better gradient.
	player-page shares the nice background
	sidebar can share the nice background, but nowadays is better, it is default to transparent, so:
		it shares bkg of player page when open
		shares bkg of whatever other page when player closed.
	hovering over an element on the sidebar gives a nice effect - hiding text behind for play buttons. (!!!!)

	__sync AND local storage
		sync used for configs
		local used for cache__

	storage now external, my own system with backend + backups
		user authenticates, stored in local storage.
		data is cached for quick reuse.
		uses session storage to ensure cache is recent
		can get useful cache extract from id, gives all information you could need, instead of just ids.

	private counterparts
		upload an album with the same name as a public album to overwrite or add songs
		ensure the artist has the same name as the public artist too.

	artist page
		artist discography shows custom albums
		artist page always has "more" button for albums/singles/eps
		auto sorts artist discography by recency

	album page
		converts old album page (used for custom uploads) to updated style
		shows cached view count for private songs
		define the primary version, to overwrite the non-deluxe songs in the deluxe album
		link other albums to overwrite songs (and can define index where overwriting starts)
		hide songs
		auto-skip songs but keep them visible
		edit metadata (title, subtitle, thumbnail URL, year, type (Album/EP/Single))
		auto-detects release type for private uploads (single if only 1 song, identical to release name)
		add new songs to an album which can fill a gap, append to the end or overwrite.
	
	playlist page
		"remove from playlist" button on a song item's dropdown presents a popup confirmation dialog before removing.
		"fancy background" version of pl/al pages, with a different ui style and the backgruond being more visible.

	for any page that has been modified, you can click the revert button to see the original
	automatic subtitles - playlists and albums get updated subtitles based on their modified or not lengths.

	player
		fixed player bar not showing year for custom albums
		player bar leads to actual artist, not private counterpart
		dropdown of player menu doesn't have "remove from playlist" button, but still "remove from queue"
		queue next automix is now interactable ("add to playlist" etc)
	
	lights:
		auto_light feature where light colour changes based on song youre listening to!
		contorl individual lights with your keyboard with light show mode
	
	notes / tags
		can write notes next to songs, for information you want to remember about them
		can give songs "tags", which are playlists collating different categories of songs.
	
	stats
		custom watchtime storing, to generate custom recaps / interesting data.
