DOING: separators for sidebar, move CFMore to a separate window when rearranging, allow dragging into it to store temporarily

todo:
	make popup title a row like any other
	
	change folder icon - select playlist menu

	fix when on artist/home page, margins are incorrect
	    - when page has elems with incorrect page-type: loop thru every elem with attribute and change to correct one.

	hover over audio controls fullscreen gives gery bkg, give it .c-player
	

	make artist albums sort by year, bcs they dont correctly.
	fix inf load after clicking end of song but going back
	remove (feat...) ? put elswhere, playerapi videldetails doesnt have it..

	border-radius issues fixed on player page, but now fix them on playlist page please :)

	player page fixes dont work on laptop with small csreen or half sized page (50/50 sreen)
	on playlist delete, wrong sidebar elem deletes.

	on remove sidebar elems, correctly fires injectMyPaperItems, but does not do editFeatures (button disappears), also, when doing inject, is the data up-to-date? (NO, WHEN IT REALOADS, SIDEBARELEMS WRONG ORDER!!)

	2024 recap made for .  .
	//top right when click to see your name etc, yt-img-shadow is too wide, pushes away
	organise "more elements" ino albums, palylists, keep order placed in though in those categories
	make it faster, feels sluggish with all playlists
	region bottom half ish cant drag into, oob, why?

	FOLDER ICONS!!!! PLEASE!!
	// carousel section of sidebar: artist icons only

	// homepage, before scrolling main body, if you scroll sidebar is bad (editing shows most)

	setting custom uploads as singles
	auto caching!!

	prompt when cannot save to sync, so you can save json and upload custom. (will have to save to local, add functionality to get data from either.)

	custom LYRICS (for custom songs, or overwrite normal) (INTERCEPT network request so they insert for us?)
	custom private release page (like normal album)
	dont fade out if is same album based on cache
	POTENTIAL ISSUE: CACHING AFTER MIDDLEWARE HAS ACTED. IS THAT BAD? -> CALL CACHING FROM MIDDLEWARE! THEN CAN STILL EDIT!
	cache non-editableHeaderRenderer playlist (non-self-owned)
	for auto loading into sorted by recency for artist, in middleware, in modifyResponse, call new request to browse with continuation found from dropdownItem, ten return that as the original data. dont forget to make the dropdown enabled if thats encessary?
	STORE MODIFICATION SEPARATE (NOT IN CACHE), SO COULD BE IN SYNC? DONT WANT CLEAR CACHE TO REMOVE MODIFICATION!!
	add links to subtitles with 3+ artists. (do this in middleware!)
	utils separate for mw and bkg, also clean namespace in mw.
	hide playlists from uploads that arent 100% uploads?

	https://github.com/th-ch/youtube-music?tab=readme-ov-file#available-plugins https://github.com/th-ch/youtube-music/tree/master/src/plugins
	FOR ARTIST "SONGS" LIST, AUTO SORT BY N OF PLAYS, HAVE CHIP RENDERER WITH CUSTOM CONTINUATION WHICH MIDDLEWARE CATCHES AND DOESNT CALL, USE THIS TO SORT BETWEEN ORIGINAL ORDER AND NOT


	https://music.youtube.com/browse/MPADUCERrDZ8oN0U_n9MphMKERcg
	doing browse/[browseId for artist discography] gives you ALL singles AND ALBUMS!!
	browseId.match("^MPAD(UC.*)"), capture group = channel id!!!!!!

	custom automix + create custom radio mixes:
	POST https://music.youtube.com/youtubei/v1/playlist/create
	request body: {title: "test", videoIds:["dsab","faskb","asdfj"]}

	make stuff not editable [wrap all in (...code)()] so keeps local scope.
	o = controllerProxy.onVideoProgress;
	controllerProxy.onVideoProgress = function(e) {
		console.log(e - last);
		last = e
		o.call(this);
	}
	when batch changing queue (call store.dispatch), await response before calling  next? thinking mostly for bulk move items in playlist.

	CACHING, UPDATE ON CLICK OF BUTTON (EG SAVE PLAYLIST)

	make utils separate for client/server

	TESTING: SYNC STORAGE LIMITS, HAVING "SYNCCONTENTS" STORED IN LOCAL
	downlaodable json storage

to cache:
	playlist/album page:
		playlist metadata
		songs: metadata, navEndpoint/playEndpoint
	artist:
		discography: albums, eps, and singles: metadata so can create own buttons
	


good bkg: https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gP-rqVOBO3v93xd1fMYuOHc1iTM28UvQijoh8jhT5OcqC0KfZSrEQ4CXJvMc8W-pkJLUSaPWlDpVr0w=w1500-h844-l90-rj

done:
	sidebar:
		custom paper elements showing images and more useful information
		reorganise it, moving playlists where you want them
		folders to contain playlists (or other folders!)
		extra playlists that youtube doesn't load in (>50) added.
		any albums saved to your library added.
		hiding elements
		our paper items added/removed when you create/delete a playlist without a refresh.
		can open playlists in new tab with middle mouse!!
		separators with/without titles depending what you want.
		rearranging elements by moving them to a temporary overflow
		carousel elements to have icons only which are still interactable.
		separators are allowe din carousels for more styling options
		"add to queue" buttons, instead of just abruptly playing.
		on cache update, sidebar refreshes too.
		our sidebar refreshes when youtube refreshes theirs.
		can middle-click primary buttons - home, explore and library
		paper items have text runs, so can navigate to album artist from subtitle.
	
	fixed background gradient on album pages.
	player-bar has nicer background.
	player-slider has nice background or better gradient.
	player-page shares the nice background
	sidebar can share the nice background, but nowadays is better, it is default to transparent, so:
		it shares bkg of player page when open
		shares bkg of whatever other page when player closed.
	hovering over an element on the sidebar gives a nice effect - hiding text behind for play buttons. (!!!!)

	__sync AND local storage
		sync used for configs
		local used for cache__

	storage now external, my own system with backend + backups
		user authenticates, stored in local storage.
		data is cached for quick reuse.

	private counterparts
		upload an album with the same name as a public album to overwrite or add songs
		ensure the artist has the same name as the public artist too.

	artist page
		artist discography shows custom albums
		artist page always has "more" button for albums/singles/eps
		auto sorts artist discography by recency

	album page
		converts old album page (used for custom uploads) to updated style
		shows cached view count for private songs
		you can define the primary version, to overwrite the non-deluxe songs in the deluxe album
		you can link other albums to overwrite songs
		you can hide songs

	for any page that has been modified, you can click the revert button to see the original
	automatic subtitles - playlists and albums get updated subtitles based on their modified or not lengths.

	player
		fixed player bar not showing year for custom albums
		player bar leads to actual artist, not private counterpart




bugs fixed:
	patch 1:

	# bkg cont opacity 0 when fading out bad
	#speaker icon secondary queue on song img
	dragging:
		# dragging down to move elem, keeps auto scrolling down when let go quickly

	#ITS WHEN WRAPPER IS CLICKED (SMALL COUPLE PIXELS BELOW PAPER ITEM)
	#make sidebar buttons reappear when youtube refreshes and hides them all (edit btn also goes)
	#when dragging folder, let go and it opens. (also when editing allow closure of active playlist??)
    #playlist page, play first song, border radius bad
    #guide-wrapper backdrop-filter: blur(6px); (artist pages are a problem)
	#?fix pausing before playling if stopping ublock doesnt
	#run mwpagechangedriven on inital load (eg after refresh)
	#mini guide does not bige bkg-cont player bkg of paper item
	#folders dont hide even tho hidden has saved
	#add padding 2px to bottom of side panel of player page
	#fix sometimes black player page, using getItems() will help.
	#remove coloured-sidebar attribute, will never use again, change to palyer-page-open, and use simpler found version whatever it was
	#make player bkg nicer, less saturated, look at everyday is christmas for example, blur(30px) only
	#fix when sidebar disappears, just redo bcs they destroy container, make all new buttons effect
	#FIX SORT-BY SCROLLBAR
	#on change of album art, document.querySelector("ytmusic-player-bar").playerApi.seekTo(0)
	#fix search result page or library scroll down, tabs bar
	#background fading does not work when player page closed. DUE TO CSS TRANSITIONS FOR OPENING/CLOSING PAGE
	Xdont do mopacity for playe rpag ebkg, just change bkg to black!!! *****
	#(when faded out, didebar play button overlaps text)
	Xplayer bar progress bar whats happening - are we transitioning or not
	player bkg stuff desont work for "the urban electric" (green edition): REMOVE "if (!nextThumb) return;"
	



how this works:
	content script injected (iso)
	messages background to start code, which normally would be in cs
	background injects individual functions into main/iso layers.
